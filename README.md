# WoLCompanion

WoLCompanion, is an application that takes your ffxiv experience to the next level. I've been playing the game for 10+ years and the issue that i've run into the most is finding a way to keep track of items and how to get them.
With this application, you will be able to search for items and see how to get them with ease. I am welcome to any and all reccomendations, and I hope you have a good time with this application
